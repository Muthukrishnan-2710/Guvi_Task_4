Difference between window , screen , document

In JavaScript, window, screen, and document are all objects that represent different aspects of the browser environment. Here's a brief overview of each:

window Object:

The window object is the top-level object in the browser's object model hierarchy.
It represents the browser window or tab and serves as the global object for JavaScript in the browser.
It contains properties and methods that provide access to various browser-related functionalities.


//screen Object:

The screen object represents the user's screen or display.
It provides information about the user's screen size, resolution, and color depth.

document Object:

The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
It provides methods and properties to manipulate the content and structure of the document.

In summary:

window deals with the overall browser window and global properties.
screen deals with properties of the user's screen or display.
document deals with the content and structure of the HTML document loaded in the browser.
These objects are part of the broader Document Object Model (DOM) that allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content and structure of a web page.
